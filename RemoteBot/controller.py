"""MicroPython remote controller for ESP-NOW driven car.

This script configures an ESP32-based handheld controller with two
momentary buttons that request forward and reverse motion plus an
analog input (potentiometer) that sets the steering angle.  Commands are
broadcast over ESP-NOW as JSON payloads with three unique throttling
states: forward, reverse, and stop.  The steering angle is encoded as a
0-180 degree value so the remote vehicle can command a standard hobby
servo.
